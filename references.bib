Using a set of industrial ADMET datasets, we compare neural networks to standard baseline models and analyze multitask learning effects with both random cross-validation and a more relevant temporal validation scheme. We confirm that multitask learning can provide modest benefits over single-task models and show that smaller datasets tend to benefit more than larger datasets from multitask learning. Additionally, we find that adding massive amounts of side information is not guaranteed to improve performance relative to simpler multitask learning. Our results emphasize that multitask effects are highly dataset-dependent, suggesting the use of dataset-specific models to maximize overall performance},

    abstract = {Abstract Molecule docking has been regarded as a routine tool for drug discovery, but its accuracy highly depends on the reliability of scoring functions (SFs). With the rapid development of machine learning (ML) techniques, ML-based SFs have gradually emerged as a promising alternative for protein–ligand binding affinity prediction and virtual screening, and most of them have shown significantly better performance than a wide range of classical SFs. Emergence of more data-hungry deep learning (DL) approaches in recent years further fascinates the exploitation of more accurate SFs. Here, we summarize the progress of traditional ML-based SFs in the last few years and provide insights into recently developed DL-based SFs. We believe that the continuous improvement in ML-based SFs can surely guide the early-stage drug design and accelerate the discovery of new drugs.

    abstract = {Abstract Molecular docking can be used to predict how strongly small-molecule binders and their chemical derivatives bind to a macromolecular target using its available three-dimensional structures. Scoring functions (SFs) are employed to rank these molecules by their predicted binding affinity (potency). A classical SF assumes a predetermined theory-inspired functional form for the relationship between the features characterizing the structure of the protein–ligand complex and its predicted binding affinity (this relationship is almost always assumed to be linear). Recent years have seen the prosperity of machine-learning SFs, which are fast regression models built instead with contemporary supervised learning algorithms. In this review, we analyzed machine-learning SFs for drug lead optimization in the 2015–2019 period. The performance gap between classical and machine-learning SFs was large and has now broadened owing to methodological improvements and the availability of more training data. Against the expectations of many experts, SFs employing deep learning techniques were not always more predictive than those based on more established machine learning techniques and, when they were, the performance gain was small. More codes and webservers are available and ready to be applied to prospective structure-based drug lead optimization studies. These have exhibited excellent predictive accuracy in compelling retrospective tests, outperforming in some cases much more computationally demanding molecular simulation-based methods. A discussion of future work completes this review. This article is categorized under: Computer and Information Science > Chemoinformatics}

    abstract = {The development of new protein–ligand scoring functions using machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, has been of significant interest. By efficiently utilizing expanded feature sets and a large set of experimental data, random forest based scoring functions (RFbScore) can achieve better correlations to experimental protein–ligand binding data with known crystal structures; however, more extensive tests indicate that such enhancement in scoring power comes with significant under-performance in docking and screening power tests compared to traditional scoring functions. In this work, to improve scoring-docking-screening powers of protein–ligand docking functions simultaneously, we have introduced a ΔvinaRF parameterization and feature selection framework based on random forest. Our developed scoring function ΔvinaRF20, which employs 20 descriptors in addition to the AutoDock Vina score, can achieve superior performance in all power tests of both CASF-2013 and CASF-2007 benchmarks compared to classical scoring functions.

We investigated seven widely used benchmarks for virtual screening and classification, and we show that the amount of AVE bias strongly correlates with the performance of ligand-based predictive methods irrespective of the predicted property, chemical fingerprint, similarity measure, or previously applied unbiasing techniques. Therefore, it may be the case that the previously reported performance of most ligand-based methods can be explained by overfitting to benchmarks rather than good prospective accuracy.},

Different methods for ligand-based predictive modeling have different inductive biases, with a particularly sharp contrast between 2D and 3D similarity methods. A unique aspect of ligand design is that the data that exist to test methodology have been largely man-made, and that this process of design involves prediction. By analyzing the molecular similarities of known drugs, we show that the inductive bias of the historic drug discovery process has a very strong 2D bias. In studying the performance of ligand-based modeling methods, it is critical to account for this issue in dataset preparation, use of computational controls, and in the interpretation of results. We propose specific strategies to explicitly address the problems posed by inductive bias considerations.},

In addition, we introduce our recent algorithm to build maximum-unbiased benchmarking sets applicable to both ligand-based and structure-based VS approaches, and its implementations to three important human histone deacetylases (HDACs) isoforms, i.e. HDAC1, HDAC6 and HDAC8. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO CV) demonstrates that the benchmarking sets built by our algorithm are maximum-unbiased as measured by property matching, ROC curves and AUCs.},

However, the dearth of reliable protein-ligand x-ray structures and binding affinity data has required the use of constructed datasets for the training and evaluation of CNN molecular recognition models. Here, we outline various sources of bias in one such widely-used dataset, the Directory of Useful Decoys: Enhanced (DUD-E). We have constructed and performed tests to investigate whether CNN models developed using DUD-E are properly learning the underlying physics of molecular recognition, as intended, or are instead learning biases inherent in the dataset itself. We find that superior enrichment efficiency in CNN models can be attributed to the analogue and decoy bias hidden in the DUD-E dataset rather than successful generalization of the pattern of protein-ligand interactions. Comparing additional deep learning models trained on PDBbind datasets, we found that their enrichment performances using DUD-E are not superior to the performance of the docking program AutoDock Vina. Together, these results suggest that biases that could be present in constructed datasets should be thoroughly evaluated before applying them to machine learning based methodology development.},

In terms of methodological development, we introduce advanced persistent homology approaches for the characterization of small molecular structures which can capture subtle structural difference. We also introduce electrostatic persistent homology to embed physics in topological invariants. These approaches encipher physics, chemistry and biology, such as hydrogen bonds, electrostatics, van der Waals interactions, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity, into topological fingerprints which, although cannot literally recast into physical interpretations, are ideally suitable for machine learning, particularly deep learning, rendering topological learning algorithms. In terms of applications, we construct a structure-based virtual screening model which outperforms other existing methods. This competitive model on the DUD database is derived by assessing the performance of a comprehensive collection of topological approaches proposed in this work and introduced in our earlier work, on the PDBBind database. The topological features constructed in this work can readily be applied to other biomolecular problems where the characterization of proteins or small molecules is needed.},

A useful way of organizing this structural data is to group the atoms of each drug molecule into ring, linker, framework, and side chain atoms. On the basis of the two-dimensional molecular structures (without regard to atom type, hybridization, and bond order), there are 1179 different frameworks among the 5120 compounds analyzed. However, the shapes of half of the drugs in the database are described by the 32 most frequently occurring frameworks. This suggests that the diversity of shapes in the set of known drugs is extremely low. In our second method of analysis, in which atom type, hybridization, and bond order are considered, more diversity is seen; there are 2506 different frameworks among the 5120 compounds in the database, and the most frequently occurring 42 frameworks account for only one-fourth of the drugs.

However, trained ML models are often treated as black boxes and are not straightforwardly interpretable. In most cases, it is unknown which features in the data are decisive and whether a model’s predictions are right for the right reason. Hence, we re-evaluated three widely used benchmark data sets in the context of ML methods and came to the conclusion that not every benchmark data set is suitable. Moreover, we demonstrate on two examples from current literature that bias is learned implicitly and unnoticed from standard benchmarks. On the basis of these results, we conclude that there is a need for eligible validation experiments and benchmark data sets suited to ML for more bias-controlled validation in ML-based SBVS.

These strategies are (1) random splitting, (2) splitting based on K-means clustering (both of actives and inactives), (3) splitting based on source database, and (4) splitting based both in the clustering and in the source database. These schemas are applied to a deep learning proteochemometrics model and to a simple logistic regression model to be used as baseline. Additionally, two different ways of describing molecules in the model are tested: (1) by their SMILES and (2) by three fingerprints. The classification performance of our deep learning-based proteochemometrics model is comparable to the state of the art. Our results show that the lack of generalization of these models is due to a bias in public molecular databases and that a restrictive cross-validation schema based on compound clustering leads to worse but more robust and credible results. Our results also show better performance when representing molecules by their fingerprints.},

  abstract = {Abstract Virtual screening (VS) in the context of drug discovery is the use of computational methods to discover novel ligands with a desired biological activity from within a larger collection of molecules. These techniques have been in use for many years, there is a wide range of methodologies available, and many successful applications have been reported in the literature. VS is often used as an alternative or a complement to High-throughput screening (HTS) or other methods to identify ligands for target validation or medicinal chemistry projects. This unit does not present an exhaustive review of available methods, or document specific instructions on use of individual software packages. Rather, a general overview of the methods available are presented and general strategies are described for VS based on accepted practices and the authors’ experience as computational chemists in an industrial research laboratory. First, the most common methods available for VS are reviewed, categorized as either receptor- or ligand-based. Subsequently, strategic considerations are presented for choosing a VS method, or a combination of methods, as well as the necessary steps to prepare, run, and analyze a VS campaign. © 2017 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

An essential component of molecular docking programs is a scoring function (SF) that can be used to identify the most stable binding pose of a ligand, when bound to a receptor protein, from among a large set of candidate poses. Despite intense efforts in developing conventional SFs, which are either force-field based, knowledge-based, or empirical, their limited docking power (or ability to successfully identify the correct pose) has been a major impediment to cost-effective drug discovery. Therefore, in this work, we explore a range of novel SFs employing different machine-learning (ML) approaches in conjunction with physicochemical and geometrical features characterizing protein-ligand complexes to predict the native or near-native pose of a ligand docked to a receptor protein's binding site. We assess the docking accuracies of these new ML SFs as well as those of conventional SFs in the context of the 2007 PDBbind benchmark dataset on both diverse and homogeneous (protein-family-specific) test sets. Further, we perform a systematic analysis of the performance of the proposed SFs in identifying native poses of ligands that are docked to novel protein targets.",

This study applies the SVM algorithm to the problem of virtual screening for molecules with a desired activity. In contrast to typical applications of the SVM, we emphasize not classification but enrichment of actives by using a modified version of the standard SVM function to rank molecules. The method employs a simple and novel criterion for picking molecular descriptors and uses cross-validation to select SVM parameters. The resulting method is more effective at enriching for active compounds with novel chemistries than binary fingerprint-based methods such as binary kernel discrimination. }

	abstract = {Scoring functions are widely applied to the evaluation of protein-ligand binding in structure-based drug design. We have conducted a comparative assessment of 16 popular scoring functions implemented in main-stream commercial software or released by academic research groups. A set of 195 diverse protein-ligand complexes with high-resolution crystal structures and reliable binding constants were selected through a systematic nonredundant sampling of the PDBbind database and used as the primary test set in our study. All scoring functions were evaluated in three aspects, that is, "docking power", "ranking power", and "scoring power", and all evaluations were independent from the context of molecular docking or virtual screening. As for "docking power", six scoring functions, including GOLD::ASP, DS::PLP1, DrugScore(PDB), GlideScore-SP, DS::LigScore, and GOLD::ChemScore, achieved success rates over 70\% when the acceptance cutoff was root-mean-square deviation < 2.0 A. Combining these scoring functions into consensus scoring schemes improved the success rates to 80\% or even higher. As for "ranking power" and "scoring power", the top four scoring functions on the primary test set were X-Score, DrugScore(CSD), DS::PLP, and SYBYL::ChemScore. They were able to correctly rank the protein-ligand complexes containing the same type of protein with success rates around 50\%. Correlation coefficients between the experimental binding constants and the binding scores computed by these scoring functions ranged from 0.545 to 0.644. Besides the primary test set, each scoring function was also tested on four additional test sets, each consisting of a certain number of protein-ligand complexes containing one particular type of protein. Our study serves as an updated benchmark for evaluating the general performance of today's scoring functions. Our results indicate that no single scoring function consistently outperforms others in all three aspects. Thus, it is important in practice to choose the appropriate scoring functions for different purposes.},

@article{Wang2003,
	abstract = {Eleven popular scoring functions have been tested on 100 protein-ligand complexes to evaluate their abilities to reproduce experimentally determined structures and binding affinities. They include four scoring functions implemented in the LigFit module in Cerius2 (LigScore, PLP, PMF, and LUDI), four scoring functions implemented in the CScore module in SYBYL (F-Score, G-Score, D-Score, and ChemScore), the scoring function implemented in the AutoDock program, and two stand-alone scoring functions (DrugScore and X-Score). These scoring functions are not tested in the context of a particular docking program. Instead, conformational sampling and scoring are separated into two consecutive steps. First, an exhaustive conformational sampling is performed by using the AutoDock program to generate an ensemble of docked conformations for each ligand molecule. This conformational ensemble is required to cover the entire conformational space as much as possible rather than to focus on a few energy minima. Then, each scoring function is applied to score this conformational ensemble to see if it can identify the experimentally observed conformation from all of the other decoys. Among all of the scoring functions under test, six of them, i.e., PLP, F-Score, LigScore, DrugScore, LUDI, and X-Score, yield success rates higher than the AutoDock scoring function. The success rates of these six scoring functions range from 66\% to 76\% if using root-mean-square deviation < or =2.0 A as the criterion. Combining any two or three of these six scoring functions into a consensus scoring scheme further improves the success rate to nearly 80\% or even higher. However, when applied to reproduce the experimentally determined binding affinities of the 100 protein-ligand complexes, only X-Score, PLP, DrugScore, and G-Score are able to give correlation coefficients over 0.50. All of the 11 scoring functions are further inspected by their abilities to construct a descriptive, funnel-shaped energy surface for protein-ligand complexation. The results indicate that X-Score and DrugScore perform better than the other ones at this aspect.},

Indeed, there are now a number of drugs whose development was heavily influenced by or based on structure-based design and screening strategies, such as HIV protease inhibitors. Nevertheless, there remain significant challenges in the application of these approaches, in particular in relation to current scoring schemes. Here, we review key concepts and specific features of small-molecule-protein docking methods, highlight selected applications and discuss recent advances that aim to address the acknowledged limitations of established approaches.},

	abstract = {Docking is a computational technique that samples conformations of small molecules in protein binding sites; scoring functions are used to assess which of these conformations best complements the protein binding site. An evaluation of 10 docking programs and 37 scoring functions was conducted against eight proteins of seven protein types for three tasks: binding mode prediction, virtual screening for lead identification, and rank-ordering by affinity for lead optimization. All of the docking programs were able to generate ligand conformations similar to crystallographically determined protein/ligand complex structures for at least one of the targets. However, scoring functions were less successful at distinguishing the crystallographic conformation from the set of docked poses. Docking programs identified active compounds from a pharmaceutically relevant pool of decoy compounds; however, no single program performed well for all of the targets. For prediction of compound affinity, none of the docking programs or scoring functions made a useful prediction of ligand binding affinity.},
